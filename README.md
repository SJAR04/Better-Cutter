# Better Cutter, Wood in Stonecutter
**Work on Minecraft Version: 1.13.X-1.14.X**

**Version soon coming: 1.15.X**

**Download: Modrinth**

## Overview
Better Cutter is a datapack that overhauls Minecraft Stonecutter, enabling it to craft wooden items like a dedicated woodworking station. Designed for players who want streamlined building without mods, it retains vanilla balance while expanding the stonecutter’s utility for all 6 classic wood types (oak, spruce, jungle, birch, dark oak, acacia).

## Features
Stonecutter Woodworking:

Craft planks, slabs, stairs, fences, doors, trapdoors, and signs directly in the stonecutter.

Vanilla-friendly ratios (e.g., 1 log = 4 planks, 1 log = 4 stairs).

Customizable Recipes:

Optional config to disable vanilla crafting table recipes (e.g., force fences to be stonecutter-only).

Adjust plank/stair yields for balance.

Optimized Performance:

Minimal lag during /reload (v3.4 improvements).

No visual glitches (axes no longer “consumed”).

## Compatibility
Works With:

Fabric, Forge, or Vanilla (no mods required!).

Most resource packs and performance mods (e.g., Sodium, OptiFine).

Conflicts:

Datapacks/mods that alter vanilla stonecutter behavior (e.g., Terralith, Vanilla Tweaks).

Not compatible with Minecraft 1.15+.

## Installation
Download BetterCutter_v3.4.zip.

Drag into your world’s datapacks folder.

Run /reload or restart your world.
